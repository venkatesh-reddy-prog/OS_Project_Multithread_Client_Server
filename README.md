# üåê Multithreaded Proxy Client-Server (OS Project)

This repository contains a solution for developing a multithreaded proxy server and a corresponding client, designed to handle URL requests and save the fetched output locally. This project demonstrates core concepts of operating systems, including threading for concurrency, and network programming (sockets).

## ‚ú® Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop a reliable and concurrent network application:

Proxy Server: The server accepts a URL requested by a client.

Fetching: The server fetches the output (e.g., HTML content) from the specified URL.

Multithreading: The server utilizes threading to handle multiple client requests simultaneously.

Client: The client receives the fetched output from the server and saves it into a local file (e.g., an HTML page) with an appropriate, descriptive name.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.x (The project is written in Python, as evidenced by client.py and server.py).

A stable network connection.

Installation

### Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/venkatesh-reddy-prog/OS_Project_Multithread_Client_Server.git

cd OS_Project_Multithread_Client_Server

### Ensure Dependencies:

Since this is a standard OS/Networking project in Python, it primarily relies on built-in libraries (socket, threading, urllib, etc.). No external pip packages are typically required, but ensure your Python environment is working correctly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

The application requires the server to be running before the client can connect.

### 1. Start the Server

Open a terminal window and run the server script:

Bash

python server.py

The server will begin listening for incoming connections on the configured host and port.

### 2. Run the Client

Open a separate terminal window and run the client script. The client will prompt you to enter the URL you wish to retrieve:

Bash

python client.py

The client will:

Connect to the server.

Send the URL provided by the user.

Receive the HTML content from the server.

Save the content to a local HTML file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

File	Role	Description

server.py	Proxy Server	Implements a socket server that listens for client connections. It uses Python's threading module to handle each client request in a new thread, ensuring concurrent operations. It handles fetching URL content (acting as a simple proxy).
client.py	Client Application	Implements the client socket connection. It handles user input for the URL, sends the request to the server, and saves the received data to a new local HTML file.
